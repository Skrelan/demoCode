Recursion 101

When implementing recursion using helper functions implent the below:

STEP 1>> Instantiate Variables ( Track state & result )
#This step refers to having a variable that will track the state of the recursion and where the final result will be stored

STEP 2>>Return the Result
#This step refers to return statment in the main functions

STEP 3>>Helper Method (when to instantiate, when to invoke[re-invoke] )

STEP4>>Base Case ( Put a base case in the Helper function, i.e the condition when Recursion stops )

STEP5>>Recursion Case ( Calls inside helper function to itself when recursion needs to be implented)
